# NexusLink
NexusLink is a long-range, dual-role TX/RX for FPV that carries low-latency H.265 video and a deterministic control link over adaptive frequency-hopping across modular bands (Sub-GHz/1.3/2.4/5.8 GHz). It auto-avoids interference, supports CRSF/MAVLink, AES-GCM security, and region profiles.
